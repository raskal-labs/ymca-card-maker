# Association presets (profiles/associations.json)

This file is only a convenience list for quickly filling **Header URL** and **Header Title** in the GUI.

Notes:
- These URLs/titles were collected from official YMCA/YWCA association websites (as of 2025-12-18).
- Associations sometimes rebrand or change domains. Treat this list as **best-effort**, not authoritative.
- The GUI always lets you edit the header fields manually, so a bad entry won't block you.

How to update:
- Edit `profiles/associations.json`
- Keep it alphabetized by `name`
- Use the shortest "main" domain when possible (no tracking params).
